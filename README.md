# django-polling: Basic polling app in Django from docs

## A Word of Thanks

This project is not original, and I am only using this project as a learning tool: all or nearly all of the code in this codebase is taken from the ![Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/intro/tutorial01/) and I take no credit for it whatsoever. Thank you very much to those from the Django team who contributed to this code in the past and made it available to people like me to learn in the documentation.
